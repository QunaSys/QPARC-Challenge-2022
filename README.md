# What is QPARC Challenge?
QPARC Challenge is an international hackathon for students, engineers, scientists, and any others who learn quantum information and chemistry around the world. Participants can access freely to Qamuy, a quantum computing cloud service, to solve challenges in combination with other quantum chemistry calculation programs.
 
From 6th to 15th of May, participants will solve challenges related to material development. On 15th May, finalists are selected for next step and prepare for presentation for final judge. On 3rd June, final judgement is held and finalists give a presentation of their solutions, which is judged by industrial and academic experts. Winners will be awarded total 10,000 USD and Qamuy free licence.

# What is new about QPARC Challenge?
(i) Key concept
The unique point of the QPARC challenge is that we start from the existing “State-of-the-art algorithm”. While many other challenges introduce existing applications to which quantum algorithms can be applied, QPARC Challenge only sets industrial problems. You can use Qamuy  to perform numerous chemical simulations.

(ii) Challenges specific to your area of expertise
In OPARC Challenge, there are two types of challenges:

 For Quantum Information Experts
 For Quantum Chemistry Experts
 
You can choose a challenge that is related to your area of ex.epertise or you're interested in. Aims and evaluation criteria for each type are shown in a table below.
